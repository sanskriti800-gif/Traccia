        <h2>What is Facial Recognition? </h2>
        <p>
          What is facial recognition?
Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual’s identity using their face. Facial recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time.

Facial recognition is a category of biometric security. Other forms of biometric software include voice recognition, fingerprint recognition, and eye retina or iris recognition. The technology is mostly used for security and law enforcement, though there is increasing interest in other areas of use.</p>
<h2>
How does facial recognition work?
</h2>
<p>
Many people are familiar with face recognition technology through the FaceID used to unlock iPhones (however, this is only one application of face recognition). Typically, facial recognition does not rely on a massive database of photos to determine an individual’s identity — it simply identifies and recognizes one person as the sole owner of the device, while limiting access to others.

Beyond unlocking phones, facial recognition works by matching the faces of people walking past special cameras, to images of people on a watch list. The watch lists can contain pictures of anyone, including people who are not suspected of any wrongdoing, and the images can come from anywhere — even from our social media accounts. Facial technology systems can vary, but in general, they tend to operate as follows:<br>
<p class="steps">
<b>Step 1: Face detection</b><br>
The camera detects and locates the image of a face, either alone or in a crowd. The image may show the person looking straight ahead or in profile.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2: Face analysis</b><br>
Next, an image of the face is captured and analyzed. Most facial recognition technology relies on 2D rather than 3D images because it can more conveniently match a 2D image with public photos or those in a database. The software reads the geometry of your face. Key factors include the distance between your eyes, the depth of your eye sockets, the distance from forehead to chin, the shape of your cheekbones, and the contour of the lips, ears, and chin. The aim is to identify the facial landmarks that are key to distinguishing your face.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3: Converting the image to data</b><br>
The face capture process transforms analog information (a face) into a set of digital information (data) based on the person's facial features. Your face's analysis is essentially turned into a mathematical formula. The numerical code is called a faceprint. In the same way that thumbprints are unique, each person has their own faceprint.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4: Finding a match</b><br>
Your faceprint is then compared against a database of other known faces. For example, the FBI has access to up to 650 million photos, drawn from various state databases. On Facebook, any photo tagged with a person’s name becomes a part of Facebook's database, which may also be used for facial recognition. If your faceprint matches an image in a facial recognition database, then a determination is made.

Of all the biometric measurements, facial recognition is considered the most natural. Intuitively, this makes sense, since we typically recognize ourselves and others by looking at faces, rather than thumbprints and irises. It is estimated that over half of the world's population is touched by facial recognition technology regularly.<br>
<br>
</p>
</p>
<h2>
How facial recognition is used
</h2>
<p>
The technology is used for a variety of purposes. These include:
<br>
<br>
<h4>Unlocking phones</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
  Various phones, including the most recent iPhones, use face recognition to unlock the device. The technology offers a powerful way to protect personal data and ensures that sensitive data remains inaccessible if the phone is stolen. Apple claims that the chance of a random face unlocking your phone is about one in 1 million.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Law enforcement</h4><br>
<br>
<p class="steps">
Facial recognition is regularly being used by law enforcement. According to this NBC report, the technology is increasing amongst law enforcement agencies within the US, and the same is true in other countries. Police collects mugshots from arrestees and compare them against local, state, and federal face recognition databases. Once an arrestee’s photo has been taken, their picture will be added to databases to be scanned whenever police carry out another criminal search.

Also, mobile face recognition allows officers to use smartphones, tablets, or other portable devices to take a photo of a driver or a pedestrian in the field and immediately compare that photo against to one or more face recognition databases to attempt an identification.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Airports and border control</h4><br>
<br>
<p class="steps">
Facial recognition has become a familiar sight at many airports around the world. Increasing numbers of travellers hold biometric passports, which allow them to skip the ordinarily long lines and instead walk through an automated ePassport control to reach the gate faster. Facial recognition not only reduces waiting times but also allows airports to improve security. The US Department of Homeland Security predicts that facial recognition will be used on 97% of travellers by 2023. As well as at airports and border crossings, the technology is used to enhance security at large-scale events such as the Olympics.
</p>
<br>

<h4>Finding missing persons</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
Facial recognition can be used to find missing persons and victims of human trafficking. Suppose missing individuals are added to a database. In that case, law enforcement can be alerted as soon as they are recognized by face recognition — whether it is in an airport, retail store, or other public space.
</p>

<h4>Reducing retail crime</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
Facial recognition is used to identify when known shoplifters, organized retail criminals, or people with a history of fraud enter stores. Photographs of individuals can be matched against large databases of criminals so that loss prevention and retail security professionals can be notified when shoppers who potentially represent a threat enter the store.
</p>

<h4>Improving retail experiences</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
The technology offers the potential to improve retail experiences for customers. For example, kiosks in stores could recognize customers, make product suggestions based on their purchase history, and point them in the right direction. “Face pay” technology could allow shoppers to skip long checkout lines with slower payment methods.
</p>

<h4>Banking</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
Biometric online banking is another benefit of face recognition. Instead of using one-time passwords, customers can authorize transactions by looking at their smartphone or computer. With facial recognition, there are no passwords for hackers to compromise. If hackers steal your photo database, 'liveless' detection – a technique used to determine whether the source of a biometric sample is a live human being or a fake representation – should (in theory) prevent them from using it for impersonation purposes. Face recognition could make debit cards and signatures a thing of the past.
</p>

<h4>Marketing and advertising</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
Marketers have used facial recognition to enhance consumer experiences. For example, frozen pizza brand DiGiorno used facial recognition for a 2017 marketing campaign where it analyzed the expressions of people at DiGiorno-themed parties to gauge people’s emotional reactions to pizza. Media companies also use facial recognition to test audience reaction to movie trailers, characters in TV pilots, and optimal placement of TV promotions. Billboards that incorporate face recognition technology – such as London’s Piccadilly Circus – means brands can trigger tailored advertisements. 
</p>

<h4>Healthcare</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
Hospitals use facial recognition to help with patient care. Healthcare providers are testing the use of facial recognition to access patient records, streamline patient registration, detect emotion and pain in patients, and even help to identify specific genetic diseases. AiCure has developed an app that uses facial recognition to ensure that people take their medication as prescribed. As biometric technology becomes less expensive, adoption within the healthcare sector is expected to increase.
</p>

<h4>Tracking student or worker attendance</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
Some educational institutions in China use face recognition to ensure students are not skipping class. Tablets are used to scan students' faces and match them to photos in a database to validate their identities. More broadly, the technology can be used for workers to sign in and out of their workplaces, so that employers can track attendance.
</p>

<h4>Recognizing drivers</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
According to this consumer report, car companies are experimenting with facial recognition to replace car keys. The technology would replace the key to access and start the car and remember drivers’ preferences for seat and mirror positions and radio station presets.
</p>

<h4>Monitoring gambling addictions</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
Facial recognition can help gambling companies protect their customers to a higher degree. Monitoring those entering and moving around gambling areas is difficult for human staff, especially in large crowded spaces such as casinos. Facial recognition technology enables companies to identify those who are registered as gambling addicts and keeps a record of their play so staff can advise when it is time to stop. Casinos can face hefty fines if gamblers on voluntary exclusion lists are caught gambling.
