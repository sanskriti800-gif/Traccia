        <h2>Face Recognition Using Neural Networks </h2>
        <p>
          Face Recognition is a recognition technique used to detect faces of individuals whose images saved in the data set. Despite the point that other methods of identification can be more accurate, face recognition has always remained a significant focus of research because of its non-meddling nature and because it is peopleâ€™s facile method of personal identification.</p>
<h2>
  Face Recognition Methods
</h2>
<p>
  There are different methods for face recognition, which are as follows-</p><br>

<h4>Geometric Based / Template Based</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
  Face recognition algorithms classified as geometry based or template based algorithms. The template-based methods can be constructed using statistical tools like SVM [Support Vector Machines], PCA [Principal Component Analysis], LDA [Linear Discriminant Analysis], Kernel methods or Trace Transforms. The geometric feature based methods analyse local facial features and their geometric relationship. It is also known as a feature-based method.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Piecemeal / Wholistic</h4><br>
<br>
<p class="steps">
  The relation between the elements or the connection of a function with the whole face not undergone into the amount, many researchers followed this approach, trying to deduce the most relevant characteristics. Some methods attempted to use the eyes, a combination of features and so on. Some Hidden Markov Model methods also fall into this category, and feature processing is very famous in face recognition.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Appearance-Based / Model-Based</h4><br>
<br>
<p class="steps">
  The appearance-based method shows a face regarding several images. An image considered as a high dimensional vector. This technique is usually used to derive a feature space from the image division. The sample image compared to the training set. On the other hand, the model-based approach tries to model a face. The new sample implemented to the model and the parameters of the model used to recognise the image.
  The appearance-based method can classify as linear or nonlinear. Ex- PCA, LDA, IDA used in direct approach whereas Kernel PCA used in nonlinear approach. On the other hand, in the model-based method can be classified as 2D or 3D Ex- Elastic Bunch Graph Matching used.
</p>
<br>

<h4>Neural Networks</h4><br>
<p class="steps">
  Neural Network has continued to use pattern recognition and classification. Kohonen was the first to show that a neuron network could be used to recognise aligned and normalised faces. There are methods, which perform feature extraction using neural networks. There are many methods, which combined with tools like PCA or LCA and make a hybrid classifier for face recognition. These are like Feed Forward Neural Network with additional bias, Self-Organizing Maps with PCA, and Convolutional Neural Networks with multi-layer perception, etc. These can increase the efficiency of the models.

<br>
<p class="steps">
 <h5 class="steps">Neural Networks with Gabor Filters</h5>
 <p class="steps">The algorithm achieves face recognition by implementing a multilayer perceptron with a back-propagation algorithm. Firstly, there is a preprocessing step. Each image normalised in phases of contrast and illumination. Then each image is processed through a Gabor filter. The Gabor filter has five orientation parameters and three spatial frequencies, so there are 15 Gabor wavelengths.<p>

<br>
 <h5 class="steps">Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models</h5>
 <p class="steps">Hidden Markov Models are a statistical tool used in face recognition. They have used in conjunction with neural networks. It generated in a neural network that trains pseudo 2D HMM. The input of this 2D HMM process is the output of the ANN, and It provides the algorithm with the proper dimensionality reduction.<p>
 
  <h5 class="steps">Fuzzy Neural Networks</h5>
  <p class="steps">The fuzzy neural networks for face recognition introduce in 2009. In this a face recognition system using a multilayer perceptron. The concept behind this approach is to capture decision surfaces in nonlinear manifolds a task that a simple MLP can hardly complete. The feature vectors are obtained using Gabor wavelength transforms.<p>
